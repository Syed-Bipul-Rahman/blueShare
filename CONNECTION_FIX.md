# Connection Fix - What Changed

## ✅ Problem Fixed

The issue was that the ViewModel was **simulating** the connection (just showing "Connected" text) but **not actually establishing** the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct socket connection.

## What I Fixed:

### 1. **Created ConnectToDeviceUseCase**
   - New use case specifically for device connection
   - Properly calls the repository's connection method
   - Location: `/domain/src/main/java/.../ConnectToDeviceUseCase.kt`

### 2. **Fixed Repository Connection Logic**
   - Now properly selects the data source (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct) based on device type
   - Actually calls `dataSource.connect(device)` which establishes the socket
   - Prefers Bluetooth for better reliability
   - Location: `/data/src/main/java/.../TransferRepositoryImpl.kt`

### 3. **Updated ViewModel**
   - Now uses `ConnectToDeviceUseCase` instead of simulating connection
   - Properly observes connection state from the repository
   - Location: `/app/src/main/java/.../TransferViewModel.kt`

### 4. **Updated TransferActivity**
   - Passes the new `ConnectToDeviceUseCase` to ViewModel
   - Location: `/app/src/main/java/TransferActivity.kt`

## How Connection Works Now:

### Before (Broken):
```
User taps "Connect"
  ↓
ViewModel shows "Connecting..."
  ↓
ViewModel shows "Connected" (FAKE - no actual connection)
  ↓
User taps "Start Transfer"
  ↓
❌ FAILS because no socket connection exists
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User taps "Connect"
  ↓
ViewModel calls ConnectToDeviceUseCase
  ↓
Repository selects Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct
  ↓
BluetoothManager/WifiDirectManager creates actual socket
  ↓
✅ Real socket connection established
  ↓
ViewModel shows "Connected" (REAL connection)
  ↓
User taps "Start Transfer"
  ↓
✅ Transfer works because socket is ready
```

## Testing Instructions:

### Device A (Sender):
1. Open app, tap "Send Files"
2. Tap "Select Files", choose 1-2 photos
3. Wait for Device B to appear in list
4. **Tap Device B**
5. **Tap "Connect"** in dialog
6. **Wait 2-5 seconds** - you'll see "Connecting..." then "Connected to [Device B]"
7. **Verify "Connected" message appears** - this means Bluetooth socket is established
8. Tap "Start Transfer"
9. **Should now work!** Progress bar will update

### Device B (Receiver):
1. Open app, tap "Receive Files"
2. Keep screen on
3. You'll see "Waiting for sender to connect..."
4. When Device A connects, you'll see "Connected to [Device A]"
5. Files will start receiving automatically
6. Check Downloads folder when complete

## What Happens During Connection:

### Bluetooth Connection (Preferred):
1. **Device B (Receiver):**
   - Creates `BluetoothServerSocket`
   - Starts listening for incoming connections on UUID: `00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`

2. **Device A (Sender):**
   - When you tap "Connect"
   - Gets the Bluetooth device by MAC address
   - Creates `BluetoothSocket` with same UUID
   - Calls `socket.connect()` (this is the real connection!)
   - Connection takes 2-5 seconds

3. **Both Devices:**
   - Once connected, socket is ready
   - When "Start Transfer" is tapped, data flows through the socket

### Wi-Fi Direct Connection:
1. Creates Wi-Fi Direct group
2. One device becomes Group Owner
3. Establishes TCP socket connection
4. (Note: Wi-Fi Direct group formation can be unreliable, so Bluetooth is preferred)

## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: Still shows "Transfer failed: Not connected"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Connection didn't complete before "Start Transfer" was tapped
2. Bluetooth connection failed

**Solution:**
1. After tapping "Connect", **wait for "Connected to [Device]" message**
2. If it doesn't appear after 10 seconds, tap device again to retry
3. Make sure Bluetooth is ON and devices are paired (app handles this)
4. Try closing and reopening both apps

### Issue: "Connecting..." but never connects

**Solution:**
1. Make sure **Location is enabled** on both devices
2. Turn Bluetooth **OFF then ON** on both devices
3. Close and reopen the app on both devices
4. Make sure devices are within 5 meters
5. Try the other device as sender (swap roles)

### Issue: Devices don't appear in list

**Solution:**
1. Make sure both devices are in Send/Receive mode
2. Make sure Location permission is granted
3. Make sure Bluetooth permission is granted
4. Turn Bluetooth OFF and ON
5. Restart the app

## Debug Logging:

If you want to see what's happening, check logcat:

```bash
adb logcat | grep BlueShare
```

You should see logs like:
- "Discovering devices..."
- "Device found: [Device Name]"
- "Connecting to device..."
- "Connection successful"
- "Sending file: [filename]"

## Architecture Flow:

```
TransferActivity
    ↓
TransferViewModel (with ConnectToDeviceUseCase)
    ↓
ConnectToDeviceUseCase
    ↓
TransferRepositoryImpl (selects Bluetooth/WiFi)
    ↓
BluetoothManager (creates real socket connection)
    ↓
BluetoothSocket.connect() ← ACTUAL CONNECTION HAPPENS HERE
```

## Key Code Changes:

### ConnectToDeviceUseCase.kt (NEW FILE)
```kotlin
operator fun invoke(device: Device): Flow<FileTransferState> {
    return repository.connectToDevice(device)
}
```

### TransferRepositoryImpl.kt (UPDATED)
```kotlin
override fun connectToDevice(device: Device): Flow<FileTransferState> = flow {
    // Select appropriate data source
    val dataSource = when (device.type) {
        TransferMethod.Bluetooth -> bluetoothDataSource
        // ...
    }

    // ACTUALLY CONNECT
    when (val result = dataSource.connect(device)) {
        is Result.Success -> emit(FileTransferState.Connected(device))
        is Result.Error -> emit(FileTransferState.Failed(result.error))
    }
}
```

### TransferViewModel.kt (UPDATED)
```kotlin
fun connectToDevice(device: Device) {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        // Use real connection use case
        connectToDeviceUseCase(device).collect { state ->
            _transferState.value = state
        }
    }
}
```

## Success Indicators:

✅ **Connection is working if:**
1. After tapping "Connect", you see "Connecting..." for 2-5 seconds
2. Then you see "Connected to [Device Name]"
3. "Start Transfer" button appears
4. When you tap "Start Transfer", progress bar starts filling
5. You see transfer speed (e.g., "500 KB/s")
6. Files appear in Downloads folder on receiver

❌ **Connection is NOT working if:**
1. "Connecting..." appears but nothing happens
2. "Connected" appears immediately (< 1 second) - this means it's still simulating
3. "Start Transfer" fails with "Not connected" error

## Performance Notes:

- **Bluetooth connection time:** 2-5 seconds typical
- **Wi-Fi Direct connection time:** 5-10 seconds (when it works)
- **Transfer speed (Bluetooth):** 300-800 KB/s
- **Transfer speed (Wi-Fi Direct):** 5-30 MB/s (much faster but less reliable)
